2023 Cosan Day: Portfolio manager with 
operational responsibility
Execution, Execution, Execution
We leave Cosan Day with a positive view of the commitment to long term potential 
and the company's reaffirmed focus on " Execution, Execution, Execution " and the 
highlight given to its irreplicable portfolio in key sectors where Brazil has unique 
advantages - which they currently see as in good shape and size (with some 
potential for divestments). Management stated it views all assets are undervalued, 
but particularly CSAN3, with buybacks as a priority desire - as long as leverage/
liquidity remains under control and growth investments in the subsidiaries are not 
at risk. Although the portfolio is mature (RAIZ, RAIL, Compass, Moove), all are in 
process of delivering key projects to unlock value in upcoming years (E2G, LRV, 
TRSP/Commit, PetroChoice consolidation), and we believe 2024 could be an 
important year for investors to regain confidence in the case after the misses in 
some expectations since 2020 for Raízen, Rumo and Compass. 
Succession: key concern for LT sustainability
Talent retention and the succession plan are key for Cosan. The Partnership program 
seeks to be the eventual succession option to Controller and Founder Rubens 
Ometto. Cosan is also focused on succession for key management positions, 
particularly as its talent pool from M&A in the past has been somewhat depleted. 
Company highlights: Market demands IPOs
Raízen : While management is positive on E2G and agricultural yield developments, 
with key deliverables for 2023/24 and 2024/25, Cosan is not "satisfied" with the 
performance in fuel distribution seen so far. Rumo : CEO Mr. Beto Abreu provided an 
update on the growth plan and conveyed a positive outlook for 2024 . Compass : 
Execution remains key with the upcoming operations of TRSP . There is the potential 
for the company to exert right of preferences in eventual privatizations of natgas 
distribution companies. Moove : Now in the "R$1bn club", Moove could seek an IPO, 
although there is currently no need. Growth remains organic and there is inorganic 
optionality after the positive surprise with PetroChoice. Vale: Cosan has more 
visibility on the development of the thesis for the investment, but is taking time to 
see how variables play out.

Raízen: all well in S&E, mobility still lagging
Cosan's CEO stated in his opening statement that, while there have been important 
advancements in investments in E2G, in ensuring productivity improvements are 
sustainable and in the sugar macro environment, the companies are not satisfied 
with the performance in Mobility / Fuel Distribution.

We are positive on Raízen given structurally higher sugar prices (a view constantly 
reiterated by CEO Mussa) and improvements in the competitive landscape for major 
fuel distribution companies in Brazil. See " An end to the storm appears on the 
horizon ".
E2G plants : the first new plant will be inaugurated by the end of the month, 
and is an important milestone in their view, to help both investors and 
potential new opportunities gain confidence in the project. Expectations are 
for each new plant to generate R$250-300mn in EBITDA per crop, with a strong 
cash conversion. The potential for anticipation of revenues of the sales 
contracts is key to the company given: 1) balance sheet and FCF support; 2) as 
example of a financing option for potential licensing of technology and 
partnerships with other players. For potential partnerships, Raízen could 
either make the investment and have the LT contract for the bagasse, or 
license the technology, although in both scenarios it would hold the 
commercialization of the E2G. 
E2G demand : demand remains robust, particularly for SAF application and 
Raízen is unable to meet the strong demand so far. Demand risk in their view 
comes from potential new technologies for SAF production, as current options 
(such as waster products and ethanol to jet) have limited feedstock 
availability currently. We view the company is eager in expanding supply of 
ethanol (particularly E2G / from both Raízen and others), in order to 
consolidate demand and de-risk potential changes to mandates and the 
development of alternatives. 
Biogas : The company continues to study best options for monetization of 
biogas and biomethane. There are 6 plants which would be close enough to 
natgas distribution grids for connection and Raízen is also analysing other 
options for the use of the molecule such as: fleet substitution; biobunker; 
biomethanol; green ammonia. 
Sugar : Raízen reaffirmed its view that sugar prices have moved structurally 
up, potentially at ~20cpp (although we note #11 May'24 is at >25cpp and 
May'25 is >21cpp). The company sees an unique combination for 2023/24 and paula.macedo@ cosan.com

Cost cuts : Raízen is looking into cost cuts of R$300-500mn per crop for the 
company as a whole, coming from a reduction in size of management and in 
part on cost rationalization. There is also an ongoing capex reduction, from 
some delays given strong rains, lower fuel and input prices. 
FCF and leverage : Raízen reaffirmed its commitment to the current leverage 
level and stated there are paths to reaching positive FCF this crop.

Fuel distribution : Raízen stated a large share of the weak results were a result 
of oversupply of diesel and Petrobras strategy on supply and pricing. On what 
the company could have done better they highlighted uncontracted sales, for 
TRR and B2B, where they saw some pressure in margins and higher sales than 
expected. They had been more contracted in Petrobras for 1Q23/24, which in 
the quarter saw higher prices than imports, however see the strategy as 
positive and that quotas with Petrobras are an important asset - which we 
agree as it may favour majors.paula.macedo@ cosan.com

Rumo: Positive message
At Cosan's Investor Day, Rumo's CEO Mr. Beto Abreu provided an update on the 
company's execution of its growth plan and conveyed a positive outlook for 2024. 
Meanwhile, Cosan ruled out a follow on for Rumo in the foreseeable future. There 
were no changes to the 2023 or the long-term guidance. Rumo praised the record 
volume achieved in August in North Operations, indicating a reduction in vandalism 
and attacks near Santos Port. Although these issues have not been fully resolved, 
Rumo anticipates a continued sustainable risk reduction through internal structure 
reinforcement, public administration action and increased social mobilization in 
the region. For 2024, the company remains constructive on the market and the 
competitiveness of its logistics solution. It sees Brazilian soy exports at 98m tons 
(+3% YoY) and corn exports at 49m tons (flat YoY). On tariffs, it sees a competitive 
tariff limit of R$258/ton vs. YTD tariff of R$205/ton in North operations, a 26% gap 
that could be captured in tariff increase.
See more in " Positive message from Cosan Day ".
Compass: 2024 is the year for marketing
Compass is focused on the execution of its operations, particularly on developing 
the marketing and services business once TRSP comes online and improving its 
natgas distribution operations. Commercialization has lagged expectations set in 
the 2020 IPO attempt, but with the start of operations of TRSP this year we see room 
for Compass to be competitive vs. other suppliers (not only on prices, but 
particularly on supply flexibility) and ramp-up volumes (see our  report on natgas for 
a comparison of suppliers contracts ), which we believe remains unpriced by the 
market and could be an important driver for the case.

Cosan S/A 13 September 2023 5IPO: To further unlock value, Compass could be near an IPO, advancing Cosan's 
intention to have its 4 businesses listed - although leverage is low, the 
company generates cash, use of proceeds is not clear, and there would be 
value to be unlocked with more visibility on the ramp-up of some projects. 
Cosan indicated that while Compass is ready, there is no rush for an IPO and 
there are projects to be delivered that could put Compass in a better position. 
Cosan presented a slide with a valuation indication of ~R$28.5bn for 100% 
Compass (equity) (which considers mid-point guidance and multiple used in 
previous deals), which compares to our valuation for the asset of R$25.3bn.

Privatization s: The company has limited visibility on how privatizations will 
advance, given this will likely be politically driven. States as Santa Catarina, 
Parana and Minas Gerais have signalled at some point intentions to privatize 
their natgas distribution companies. Compass could eventually exert its right 
of preference for potential privatizations. 
TRSP : Commissioning will start later this year, with the initial supply contract 
to CGAS, which reaches ~3mcmd, to start in January. The company is doing the 
process with cautious given complexity and unique operation.
Commercialization : Compass sees it has an unique position of being able to 
offer clients flexibility, something domestic natgas producers are unable to. 
While the free market has lagged, Compass believes once the TRSP is 
concluded it may begin to advance in negotiations. Compass also flagged the 
potential for up to 3mcmd in its newly proposed B2B off-grid LNG solutions. We 
are more conservative and assume Compass ramps-up to 12mcmd by 2030.

Moove: welcome to the R$1bn club
The highlight was Moove surpassing the R$1bn EBITDA club within Cosan. A key 
factor highlighted was the company's unique focus in lubricants, while other players 
are part of larger operations (integrated majors, or downstream companies), and 
that the sector is fragmented with the potential for consolidation - organic and 
inorganic.

Growth : Organic growth continues to be an important driver for the 
development of the business. Moove is looking towards potential inorganic 
growth as well, although its current focus is on execution of its portfolio. The 
company is seeking to "get better, to get bigger", without loosing focus on 
building LT strength, but this has translated into results quicker than 
expected. 
IPO: Moove is ready for an IPO and the company is trying to educate the 
market on the sector and business, particularly given lack of clear peers. 
There is no obvious need for use of proceeds, but the company is analysing 
growth projects and available cash could help to provide comfort for future

Vale: few details
Cosan provided limited details on their view on Vale, particularly given its CEO 
position as a Board member for the mining company. Cosan sees its investments as in 
"early days", but an interest from the current Board in growth and in making things 
work. The investment in the mining company is different from its other controlled 
operations and this leads to a different, slower, influence Cosan may play in Vale - 
also impacted by Vale's longer investment cycles. 
On the acquisition, Cosan does not see pressure for a rush in decisions either way 
(increasing its direct stake, reducing it, exerting its optionalities in the structure). 
2024 is a key year to observe how the thesis develops for Cosan, as key variables in 
their view are in part mapped out, but they need time to understand how these 
develop.  paula.macedo@ cosan.com

Company Description
Cosan is a Brazil-based holding company, with business segments operating in fuel 
distribution (Raízen Combustíveis), sugar & ethanol (Raízen Energia), lubricants 
(Moove), logistics (Rumo) and natural gas (Compass). The latter includes Comgas, the 
largest natural gas distributor in Brazil.
Valuation Method and Risk Statement
Cosan: The following are key risks to Cosan share price: 1) no regulatory framework 
changes in the fuel distribution segment; 2) Unpredictable weather; and 3) Sugar and 
ethanol prices. Our price target for Cosan is a result of a DCF/SOTP-based considering 
each segment. 
Rumo: Our PT for RUMO is based on DCF . Railway transportation in Brazil is regulated by 
the Federal government ground transportation agency. Changes in the regulatory 
framework could have negative consequences for industry profitability. RUMO and other 
rail companies could be affected by GDP growth, inflation, diesel prices and the FX rate. 
Natural disasters and unexpected crop failures could also affect operations. 
Additionally, COVID-19 crisis could disrupt grain transportation in Brazil or other regions 
of the World, potentially impacting Rumo's grain transport to the ports. 
Raízen: Our price target for Raízen is SOTP/multiple based and considers an EV/EBITDA 
for each of the company’s segments. Key risks include: 1) climate conditions; 2) the 
regulatory framework on fuels in Brazil, Argentina and Europe; 3) commodities (sugar, 
ethanol, gasoline, oil) prices. 
Vale: Our price target is based on a EV/EBITDA-based methodology, backed up by DCF . 
The Latam mining sector, including Vale, is subject to relatively high volatility and 
several risk factors. These include but are not limited to commodity price volatility; 
regulatory changes; production disruptions; labor issues; equipment delays; unfavorable 
weather, and more.

Cosan S/A 13 September 2023 13KEY DEFINITIONS:  Forecast Stock Return (FSR)  is defined as expected percentage price appreciation plus gross dividend yield 
over the next 12 months. In some cases, this yield may be based on accrued dividends. Market Return Assumption (MRA)  is 
defined as the one-year local market interest rate plus 5% (a proxy for, and not a forecast of, the equity risk premium). Under 
Review (UR)  Stocks may be flagged as UR by the analyst, indicating that the stock's price target and/or rating are subject to 
possible change in the near term, usually in response to an event that may affect the investment case or valuation. Short-Term 
Ratings  reflect the expected near-term (up to three months) performance of the stock and do not reflect any change in the 
fundamental view or investment case. Equity Price Targets  have an investment horizon of 12 months.
EXCEPTIONS AND SPECIAL CASES:  UK and European Investment Fund ratings and definitions are: Buy:  Positive on factors 
such as structure, management, performance record, discount; Neutral:  Neutral on factors such as structure, management, 
performance record, discount; Sell: Negative on factors such as structure, management, performance record, discount. Core 
Banding Exceptions (CBE):  Exceptions to the standard +/-6% bands may be granted by the Investment Review Committee (IRC). 
Factors considered by the IRC include the stock's volatility and the credit spread of the respective company's debt. As a result, 
stocks deemed to be very high or low risk may be subject to higher or lower bands as they relate to the rating. When such 
exceptions apply, they will be identified in the Company Disclosures table in the relevant research piece.

options, you must receive a copy of "The Characteristics and Risks of Standardized Options." You may read the document at https://www.theocc.com/
publications/risks/riskchap1.jsp  or ask your salesperson for a copy. Various theoretical explanations of the risks associated with these instruments have 
been published. Supporting documentation for any claims, comparisons, recommendations, statistics or other technical data will be supplied upon 
request. Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results. Transaction costs may be significant in option strategies calling for multiple 
purchases and sales of options, such as spreads and straddles. Because of the importance of tax considerations to many options transactions, the investor 
considering options should consult with his/her tax advisor as to how taxes affect the outcome of contemplated options transactions.
Mortgage and asset-backed securities may involve a high degree of risk and may be highly volatile in response to fluctuations in interest rates or other 
market conditions. Foreign currency rates of exchange may adversely affect the value, price or income of any security or related instrument referred to 
in the document. For investment advice, trade execution or other enquiries, clients should contact their local sales representative.
The value of any investment or income may go down as well as up, and investors may not get back the full (or any) amount invested. Past performance is 
not necessarily a guide to future performance. Neither UBS nor any of its directors, employees or agents accepts any liability for any loss (including 
investment loss) or damage arising out of the use of all or any of the Information.
Prior to making any investment or financial decisions, any recipient of this document or the information should take steps to understand the risk and 
return of the investment and seek individualized advice from his or her personal financial, legal, tax and other professional advisors that takes into 
account all the particular facts and circumstances of his or her investment objectives.

Investing in structured investments involves significant risks. For a detailed discussion of the risks involved in investing in any particular structured investment, you 
must read the relevant offering materials for that investment. Structured investments are unsecured obligations of a particular issuer with returns linked to the 
performance of an underlying asset. Depending on the terms of the investment, investors could lose all or a substantial portion of their investment based on the 
performance of the underlying asset. Investors could also lose their entire investment if the issuer becomes insolvent. UBS does not guarantee in any way the 
obligations or the financial condition of any issuer or the accuracy of any financial information provided by any issuer. Structured investments are not traditional 
investments and investing in a structured investment is not equivalent to investing directly in the underlying asset. Structured investments may have limited or no 
liquidity, and investors should be prepared to hold their investment to maturity. The return of structured investments may be limited by a maximum gain, 
participation rate or other feature. Structured investments may include call features and, if a structured investment is called early, investors would not earn any 
further return and may not be able to reinvest in similar investments with similar terms. Structured investments include costs and fees which are generally 
embedded in the price of the investment. The tax treatment of a structured investment may be complex and may differ from a direct investment in the underlying

Important Information About Sustainable Investing Strategies : Sustainable investing strategies aim to consider and incorporate environmental, social and 
governance (ESG) factors into investment process and portfolio construction. Strategies across geographies approach ESG analysis and incorporate the findings in a 
variety of ways. Incorporating ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may inhibit the portfolio manager’s ability to participate in certain investment 
opportunities that otherwise would be consistent with its investment objective and other principal investment strategies. The returns on a portfolio incorporating 
ESG factors or Sustainable Investing considerations may be lower or higher than portfolios where ESG factors, exclusions, or other sustainability issues are not 
considered by the portfolio manager, and the investment opportunities available to such portfolios may differ.
Within the past 12 months UBS Switzerland AG, its affiliates or subsidiaries may have received or provided investment services and activities or ancillary services as

Cosan Day: Consolidating the growth opportunities of its portfolio
12 September 2023 | Equity | Brazil | Food-Commodi ties
CSAN3 BZCSAN US
Key takeaways
Cosan hosted its investor day. The company reinforced its bullish view on growth of the existing portfolio and
optionalities.
Cosan could accelerate buyback and increase stake in the subsidiaries with no equity oﬀerings expected in
2023.
We maintain Buy on Cosan as it should beneﬁt from lower interest rates and potential value unlock from the
subsidiaries.
Existing portf olio has plenty of gro wth opportunities
Cosan hosted its Investor Day. Aﬅer the acquisition of a 5% stake at Vale in 2022, we understand Cosan is focused on maximizing value of the existing
portfolio and managing the capital structure. Management believes there are signiﬁcant growth opportunities at the subsidiaries, and in their view, those
are not priced in. We maintain our Buy rating on the stock, as Cosan should beneﬁt from lower interest rates, while potential listing of Moove and Compass,
as previously stated by management, could unlock further value.
Cosan has successful track record of capital allocation
Cosan has established itself as a portfolio manager of unique assets in Brazil. The company demonstrated its ability to generate solid returns, with IRRs
above 20%. Management highlighted Moove as a successful case. Cosan got the business for zero value when it acquired Exxon's assets in Brazil, as it had
negative EBITDA. They believe Moove could now be worth 4x the value paid for the entire Exxon business in 2008.
Vale: New investment model, optimal stake to be deﬁned
Vale is a new type of investment since Cosan is not the controlling shareholder and only has a seat at the Board. However, management believes Cosan has
become a relevant shareholder and can gradually contribute to unlock value of the company, mainly through management, and governance. In this scenario,
the ﬂexible funding structure of the deal allows Cosan to not only better manage liquidity but also to decide what is the optimal ﬁnal exposure it wants to
have to Vale.
What's next: buybacks, no equity oﬀ ering in short-term
Management believes all the subsidiaries and therefore Cosan shares are under-valued. As such, they want to eventually accelerate the buyback of Cosan
shares and would also be willing to have a bigger stake in the subsidiaries. However, Cosan is assessing the company's capital structure. Also, management
reiterated they don't plan to issue equity at Rumo nor do the listing of Moove and Compass in 2023.

Cosan has an irreplicable portf olio, exposed to important tailwinds such as decarbonization. There is a lot of intrinsic gro wth in the existing
portf olio.
On Compass, most of inorganic gro wth is done and from no w on the f ocus is on expanding Comg ás, replicating the Comg ás' playbook to Commit,
and dev eloping a Marketing & Services business giv en the start of the operations of regasiﬁcation terminal.
On Rumo, there is still a lot of opportunities to expand the business and Lucas do Rio V erde is a f ocus. On Raizen, management is f ocused on
impro ving the results of Mobility , while the execution on sugarcane is on track.
On Moo ve, aﬅer the acquisition of P etroChoice last y ear (no w named Moo ve USA), they want to replicate the model from US in Europe.
Finally , Cosan Inv estiments has been w orking on portf olio rationalization and is no w focused on land and mining.
Cosan is in the right sectors, with the right size and the right management model. Gro wth opportunities are there in each business and there are
some optionalities. The f ocus of Cosan no w is on execution, which should ultimately lead to EBITDA gro wth and better returns.
Cosan 's responsible print: holding is f ocused on risk management of the operating companies, people, inno vation, capital allocation and
operational excellence, and also on assuring partnership is w orking.
Regarding the partnership: the main value is exchanging ideas within the company 's leadership team.
Internationalization: Raizen has opportunities to produce E2G outside Brazil in countries that hav e sugarcane as US (F lorida and Louisiana), India,
Thailand and Australia. The IRA in the US and Green Deal in Europe are great supporters of the biofuel agenda. At Compass, local opportunities
are still v ery solid. Going abroad is not part of short-term plans.
Risk to the company is to hav e the right people, the right suppliers to execute the gro wth agenda at the right time.
 
Finance
Mr. Ricardo Lewin (Cosan 's CFO)
Cosan has a resilient portf olio and has been gro wing despite
Returns (IRR): 21% at Raizen (from 2011-2023), 23% at Rumo (2014-2023), 22% at Compass (2012-2023), 20% at Moo ve (2011-2023), 25% on
LandCo.
Dividends and interest-on-capital are the main source of cash to Cosan and this source has started to be more div ersiﬁed in the recent y ears,
with Moo ve, LandCo and V ale paying dividends.
Leverage: av erage maturity is 5 y ears. They issued R$4.5bn of cash this y ear and the company is co vered f or the payment of the ﬁrst tranche of
payments of V ale deal. They hav e pre-paid ~R$300mn of the derivativ es structure.
 
Cosan's capital allocation strategy
Mr. Marcelo Martins  (Cosan 's CSO)
Buyback w ould be the most interesting inv estment to be made no w. They are assessing this but will certainly do at some point in time. However,
they also need to address the capital needs of the subsidiaries in order to giv e them ﬂexibility . They w ould also like to hav e bigger stakes in the
subsidiaries, but Cosan shares seem the cheapest at this moment.
Moove is a case of success of capital allocation. Cosan paid US$500mn f or ExxonMobil assets in Brazil in 2008 and b y then they attributed zero
value to lubes. If Moo ve does an IPO, which could ev entually happen, Cosan is looking f or at least 4x times the value in USD they paid f or the
entire Exxon business in 2008.
Growth of Cosan has been ﬁnanced b y leverage and equity at the subsidiaries. This is ho w they want to continue to gro w. They want to hav e a
ﬂexible capital structure  and w ill not  dilute Cosan 's stake at a value they don 't think it is adequate.
Management believ es all of the company 's subsidiaries are under-valued , namely Compass, LandCo, 2  generation ethanol, Moo ve.
In July , Rumo appro ved an increase of its authorized capital. Cosan does not plan to do an equity oﬀ ering at Rumo at this point.
Compass ' IPO: they tried to do an IPO in 2020, which was not concluded. They could ev entually do an IPO this y ear. They could reassess in 2024.
 
Compass
Mr. Nelson Gomes (CEO)
Natural gas market: the war betw een Russia and Ukraine led to important changes in the market, and resulted in inv estments in regasiﬁcation
and liquefaction, making gas a more global commodity .
Natural gas demand should continue to gro w given: 1) biomethane demand has been gro wing giv en lower carbon f ootprint; 2) distributors
continue to gro w the netw orks and free market has been ramping-up; 3) B2B gas market; 4) thermoelectric plants.
On the supply side: 1) supply from Bolivia has been declining and could be near zero b y 2030; 2) supply from P etrobras requires inv estments in
the pre-salt; and 3) biomethane supply has been gro wing but still small . As such, liquiﬁed natural gas (GNL) should remain the main source of gas
in Brazil.
Compass ' focus from 2023, it to monetize the gas molecule. The company will be divided in tw o business: 1) distribution via Comg ás and
Commit ; and 2) Marketing & Services . This is  new business at early stages that comprises i) Santos regasiﬁcation terminal, ii) GNL B2B; iii)
Biomethane and iv) commercialization.
On Distribution : Compass  acquired Gaspetro with 18 distributors. It has sold already six and should sell ﬁv e more until the end of the y ear, since
it wants to hav e a greater f ocus in the Center-South region.
It has inv ested a lot on digitalization through remote meters and online channels with clients. At Comg ás, it is connecting more than 160k
of new clients ev ery year. At Commit , it has  tripled the y early connections vs. the previous y ear. Renew ed Compagas concession f or 30
years and changed from cost plus to price cap model .
The best distributor f or Commit is still far worse than Comg ás in 2012, regarding residential penetration, margin and opex per client.
Commit and Comg ás are also belo w other countries as Colombia, which ultimately means there is still room to double Comg ás. All the
decisions of Commit are made together with Mitsui  & Co.
Sulgás: Surprised on the upside captured b y the acquisition. Though t it would double the number of connections and deliv ered a 3x
increase. It also cut the connection costs b y half with synergies of the other businesses.
Marketing & Servi ces: this is a new and incipient business. Compass will source gas from sev eral sources  (GNL, natural gas and biomethane) and
sell this gas to clients that are connected (or not ) in the company 's pipeline. Gas can be transported oﬀ -grid (truck) and on-grid (pipeline).
The ﬁrst asset of this business is the regasiﬁcation terminal in Santos. F rom this terminal, they can  storage gas in a connected ship and
transport gas via trucks.ndAccessible V ersion
Terminal has capacity of 14mn m3 /day and has 3mn already sold to Comg ás. They believ e potential demand in Brazil  can be of 100mn
m3/day ,
Biomethane : Compass signed partnership with Orizon (Orizon is the largest manager of solid residuals in the country) . There is a  supply
agreement lasting 20 y ears, through which Orizon sells biogas to a NewCo (company controlled b y Compass) that has a puriﬁcation plant
and this company then sells the biomethane to Compass that ultimately sells the gas via oﬀtake agreements .
Compass has paid R$7bn in dividends in the last f our y ears. It should continue to pay dividends despite the change in sub ventions reserv es.
Comg ás has already paid dividends to Compass, and it should continue to return capital to Cosan giv en the lack of relevant inv estments in the
short term.
What is next? At  Comg ás, focus is to do  more of the same, grow the netw ork with great execution and eﬃciency . At Commit , focus is to replicate
Comg ás' playbook in the Center-South and eventually exercise pref erred rights when and if some of the distributors are privatized . At Marketing
& Services , focus is to add biomethane to the portf olio, and add clients oﬀ and on grid.
 
Moove
Mr. F ilipe Aﬀ onso F erreira (CEO)
Lubes is bey ond light v ehicles. Lubes are used in ev ery equipment, which bring a lot of complexity to the category , demanding a high lev el of
specialization and c ustomization .
Supply chain inv olves: 1) basic oil, additiv es, inputs; 2) f ormulation; 3) manufacturing; 4) logistics and distribution; 5) sales and marketing. B2C
and B2B are classic model s of the business and each of them requires diﬀ erent skills, kno wledge, and specialization.
Moove is highly f ocused on the sell -out so the post-sale is a v ery strong capability .
Moove Performance System: this is a model they can replicate in each territory , adjusted b y the maturity of each region. This is based on supply
intelligence, lean structure, rev enue management and sales execution.
Moove had a 30% EBITDA CAGR in South America since 2017, with almost 10p.p. of market share.
In Europe, they want to lev erage the f ootprint to further gro w in the region. EBITDA in the region grew 42% betw een 2017 and 2022.
In North America, Moo ve has a relevant and robust distribution platf orm, and the acquisition of P etroChoice in 2022 was v ery successful. Moo ve
is 20% of the Mobil v olumes in the US.
LTM EBITDA has reached o ver R$1bn.
Total addressable market of lubes is 18bn liters in the regions Moo ve already operates. Moo ve has 20% share in Brazil and lo w-mid single digit in
US and Europe. There is a lot of opportunities to gro w going f orward.
 
Rumo
Mr. Beto Abreu (CEO)
Please ref er to the report  (https://rsch.baml.com/r?q=wmFwzk -Rxt3mdmAxvZ4YjA)  of our LatAm T ransportation team about the company f or additional
details.
Commercial execution should lead to higher yields as the company has a 26% gap to alternate logistic solutions in Mato Grosso. Rumo wants to
close this gap  in 2024 .
Volume plateau is still far away as Malha P aulista is gro wing in capacity and Santos port is expanding. Gro wth will not be linear though and there
will be a step change from 2025 onwards. The company still has room to gro w in Malha Central as the company has 25% share of grain exports
in Goi ás and it expects to increase its relevance in the region.
Rumo is discussing the required inv estments in Malha P aulista to impro ve capacity , but there are no risks to the contract in place. Rumo was the
one asking f or a revision instead of the regulators.
Follow-on is not a priority no w. The company appro ved an authorization to increase capital as a ﬂexibility tool rather than a deﬁnite one. Cosan
likes the asset and w ould like to increase its exposure as it is the case f or the other businesses.
 
Raizen
Mr. Ricardo Mussa (CEO)
Raizen inv ested R$2.5bn in saf ety and environment in the last ﬁv e years
Execution on sugarcane remains on track - record lev els of yields f or cane 1  cut in this season and in line with peers f or the 2  and 3  cuts.
2/3 of the cane are at optimal lev els, and at the end of the season should hav e 80%.
TCH (total cane per hectare) f or own sugarcane in the 2023/24 season is up 29%Y oY (April-August) - crushing should rise 17% to 82mn tons.
Since Raizen Investor Day in May , Raizen became the ﬁrst ethanol producer in the w orld to get the CORSIA (Carbon Oﬀsetting and Reduction
Scheme f or International A viation) certiﬁcation from International Civil A viation Organization. The certiﬁcation is required f or the ethanol to be
used in SAF (Sustainable A viation Fuel) production. Raizen believ es SAF can hav e a similar impact to ethanol demand that ﬂex fuel v ehicles had
several y ears ago.
Raizen has ﬁv e plants of 2  generation ethanol (E2G) under construction and 8 are already sold under long-term contracts with T riple A
companies. This eliminates the commercial risk of the business.
Inauguration of Bonﬁm E2G plant is on September 28 .
Constructiv e view on sugar prices. Raizen believ es sugar prices should remain at high lev els giv en steady demand gro wth and limited supply .
Company is div erting capex to increase sugar production on lo w-hanging fruit activities.
Mobility: it has been the most challenging business in the short-term. Diesel imports account f or 25%-30% of the total supply in Brazil and
import prices w ere much lo wer than local prices in the FY1Q24 (April-June). This trend has rev ersed. Raizen is more exposed to local supply and
margins hav e been reco vering.
Aside from market conditions, the company remains f ocused on operational excellence, and expanding the stations netw ork with solid
proﬁtability lev els.
Could reduce SG&A b y R$500mn going f orward.
Performance of lubes is good, with record results. At Shell Box, the goal is to reach R$10bn of transactions this y ear, while the ramp-up of the
proximity business is solid and should reach 2000 stores b y the end of the y ear.

Cosan Inv estiments
Mr. Leonardo P ontes (CEO)
Cosan Inv estiments is the v ehicle through which Cosan allocates capital in relevant opportunities with great optionalities.
Focused no w on V ale, LandCo, Sao Luis P ort and F iﬅh W all (venture capital). I n the last y ear and a half, there w ere R$21bn inv ested (R$17.4bn at
Vale, R$2.5bn in land, R$0.8mn at the port).
Vale: f or the ﬁrst time, Cosan does not hav e the control of an inv ested company . However, this is a n irreplicable asset, exposed to energy
transition through lo w carbon mining activity , hard currency . Vale is complementary to Cosan 's dividend inﬂo w. Cosan has the option to hav e a
bigger stake and could do so if beneﬁts start materializing. Recently , the company has exercised some options that w ere in the money .
The main ways to unlock value: people, go vernance. Aﬅer the deal on Base Metals, they hav e a new Chairman f or the business, which is an
example of ho w they can unlock value in this division.
LandCo: a portf olio of 320k hectares under management (53% sugarcane, 44% grains, 3% others). Cosan believ es there is a strong potential of
appreciation of the land going f orward. They also believ e that each farm/asset has its potential and can turno ver the asset. There is opportunity
to inv est in new crops, partnerships and irrigation. Believ es the real value of the land is ev en higher than the third-party appraisals. The renewal
of leasing agreements has been positiv e and with better conditions than the previous deals. This goes in the same direction of the land prices in
Brazil.
Sao Luis P ort: Cosan acquired the rights o ver the port. Construction could start as soon as 2024. Its capacity should total 115mm tons in the long
term, and it is a strategic asset f or its potential joint v enture in the mining business if all precedent metrics are met.
Fiﬅh W all: this v ehicle enables Cosan to be exposed to inno vation and disruptiv e technology through v enture-capital.

Net/Net:  Today (September 12), Cosan held its investor day, including important discussions with 
Rumo’s top management. Overall, comments seemed quite optimistic regarding the supply and 
demand outlook, implying a price increase of potentially up to 26% YoY for 1H24. Moreover, 
Rumo management shared details on the development of its main expansion projects, and walked 
through assessments of main operational bottlenecks and how these might be overcome.
Pricing in 2024.  The company highlighted the 1H23 pricing disparity between Rumo's Northern 
Operations vs. what they considered to be the best transportation alternative, Northern Arc, 
implying a potential price increase of up to 26% YoY in 1H24 ( Figure 1 ). We think this disparity could 
trigger earnings revisions as our recent discussions with investors pointed to a more conservative 
approach for pricing in their models.
Paulista network.  Rumo stressed that 22% of the total investment pipeline for Paulista Network 
has already been deployed, which has improved capacity. With the expansion plan conclusion, 
including initiatives such as PTC, railway upgrade, larger trains, and lines, Rumo forecasts 75 Mt 
(+42% vs. LTM, Figure 2 ) of capacity. Management also mentioned discussions with government 
for a specific contract amendment to potentially reallocate part of the initial investment schedule 
to other projects that in their assessment could be more valuable for both parties.
Santos Port capacity.  Rumo mentioned their short-term focus on working to increase the port’s 
efficiency and capacity, and detailed the already ongoing investment projects being done by Rumo 
itself and other stakeholders. To further increase Santos Port capacity to 77 Mt in 2025 (+51% 
vs. 2023), management highlighted the FIPS importance for future investments, and also some 
projects: Novo Valongo  (improving port access) and STS11, expected to be launched in 2025, adding 
16 Mt the port’s capacity ( Figure 3 ).
LRV.  Rumo management mentioned that the first 34km stretch is being built, and an additional 
150km stretch is expected for 2024, while also reiterating its expectations for Campo Verde’s 
terminal start-up in 2026. Moreover, management highlighted the relevance of a close relationship 
with MT government to build an integrated logistics project, leading to lower overall grains logistics 
cost, increasing MT export’s competitiveness.
